# git-demo
Memory copy scripts written in the Julia language to evaluate peak memory throughput of CPUs and Nvidia GPUs relying on [CUDA.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl) and [BenchmarkTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl).

## Running the scripts
To run the scripts access to a GPU resource is required.

Launch Julia, instantiate the project and execute the scripts located in the [scripts](scripts) folder.
